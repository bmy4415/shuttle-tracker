# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new or empty project directory. The shuttle-app project structure has not yet been initialized.

## Setup Instructions

This project will need to be initialized with the appropriate framework and dependencies. Common setup patterns for shuttle applications include:

- Rust-based shuttle projects: Initialize with `cargo shuttle init`
- Node.js-based projects: Initialize with `npm init` or framework-specific commands
- Other frameworks: Follow respective initialization procedures

## Development Commands

Once the project is set up, common commands will include:

- Build: (To be determined based on project type)
- Test: (To be determined based on project type)  
- Lint: (To be determined based on project type)
- Local development: (To be determined based on project type)

## Architecture

Project architecture will be documented here once the codebase is established.
